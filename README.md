## Prerequisites

The prerequisites that you have to install before using the app
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
## Installation

TrackMe requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the frontend server.

```sh
cd air-monitoring
npm i
npm start
```



## Out of Scope
-  Line Chart of selected city aqi vs time
-  Progressive web application

## Time Taken
-  It took me around 1.5 days ( i.e 14 hours ) to build the single page application
-  Reading antv ( charting library ) documentation  - 4 hours
-  Code setup and building the charts and table - 6 hours
-  Setting up CICD Pipeline and deploying the code - 2 hours
-  Finishing up and writing the readme file - 2 hours
-  For me the part that took extra time was using a new charting library , i am familiar with billboardjs ( js charting library ). But i wanted to use a new library to get more crisp-ui so i went on with the ant vision library.
